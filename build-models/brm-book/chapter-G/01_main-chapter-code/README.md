# Appendix G: Building a Chat Interface



This folder contains code for running a ChatGPT-like user interface to interact with the LLMs used and/or developed in this book, as shown below.

To implement this user interface, we use the open-source [Chainlit Python package](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit).

&nbsp;
## Step 1: Install dependencies

Use Python 3.13 for this appendix. Chainlit currently does not support Python 3.14 (see the [upstream issue](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit/issues/2952)). On Python 3.14, installing the repository's `extra` dependencies skips Chainlit.

First, navigate to this folder from the repository root:

```bash
cd chG/01_main-chapter-code
```

If you are using `pip`, create a Python 3.13 virtual environment in this folder and install the dependencies. On macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e "../..[extra]"
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e "../..[extra]"
```

If you are using `uv`, skip the `pip` commands above. The `uv run` command in Step 2 creates an isolated Python 3.13 environment and installs the repository's `extra` dependencies. This also works when your main project environment uses Python 3.14.

&nbsp;

## Step 2: Run `app` code

This folder contains 2 files:

1. [`qwen3_chat_interface.py`](qwen3_chat_interface.py): This file loads and uses the Qwen3 0.6B model in thinking mode.
2. [`qwen3_chat_interface_multiturn.py`](qwen3_chat_interface_multiturn.py): The same as above, but configured to remember the message history.

(Open and inspect these files to learn more.)

Run one of the following commands from the terminal to start the UI server:

```bash
chainlit run qwen3_chat_interface.py
```

or, if you are using `uv`:

```bash
uv run --isolated --python 3.13 --extra extra chainlit run qwen3_chat_interface.py
```

Running one of the commands above should open a new browser tab where you can interact with the model. If the browser tab does not open automatically, inspect the terminal command and copy the local address into your browser address bar (usually, the address is `http://localhost:8000`).

## Using a custom checkpoint

Since `chainlit run ...` owns the command-line arguments, these scripts read a custom checkpoint path from the `CHECKPOINT_PATH` environment variable instead of `argparse`.

Terminal example:

```bash
CHECKPOINT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/qwen3-0.6B-distill-step06682-epoch1.pth \
uv run --isolated --python 3.13 --extra extra \
  chainlit run qwen3_chat_interface.py
```

Notes:

- Keep `WHICH_MODEL` in the script aligned with the tokenizer the checkpoint expects.
- The chapter 8 checkpoints from [`ch08/05_download_training_checkpoints`](../../chapter-08/05_download_training_checkpoints) use the reasoning tokenizer, so use `WHICH_MODEL = "reasoning"`.
- When `CHECKPOINT_PATH` is set, the script only downloads the tokenizer into `LOCAL_DIR`; it does not re-download the default model weights.
